# OOP Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains exercises designed to help you understand various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each concept is organized into its own directory with subdirectories for individual exercises.

## Concepts

1. [Abstraction](./abstraction)
2. [Encapsulation](./encapsulation)
3. [Friendship Concept](./friendship-concept)
4. [Inheritance](./inheritance)
5. [Multiple Inheritance](./multiple_inheritance)
6. [Overloading Operators and Constructors](./overloading_operators_constructors)
7. [Polymorphism](./polymorshism)

## Special Topics

- [Exception Handling (try-catch)](./try-catch)

## Directory Structure

- **abstraction**: Exercises related to the concept of abstraction.
- **encapsulation**: Exercises related to the concept of encapsulation.
- **friendship-concept**: Exercises related to the concept of friendship in C++.
- **inheritance**: Exercises related to the concept of inheritance.
- **multiple_inheritance**: Exercises related to the concept of multiple inheritance.
- **overloading_operators_constructors**: Exercises related to overloading operators and constructors.
- **polymorshism**: Exercises related to the concept of polymorphism.
- **try-catch**: Exercises related to exception handling using try-catch blocks.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to the Concept Directory**: Each concept has its own directory. Navigate to the directory of the concept you want to study.
2. **Exercises**: Inside each concept directory, you will find subdirectories for individual exercises (e.g., `exercise1`, `exercise2`, etc.).
3. **Solution Files**: Each exercise directory contains a `solution.cpp` file where you can write your solutions.

## Example

To start with the abstraction exercises, navigate to the `abstraction` directory:

```sh
cd abstraction
